# take-back-day-microsite
Creating the dynamic microsite that will weave together and host the other Take Back Day projects:

Project 1: A map with filters and zip code that shows the availability of prescription drug take back sites and frequency of take back events. 

Project 2: A texting reminder service that would allow users to get info about take back programs.

Project 3: Branding and Assets toolkits for advocates to promote Take Back Day and take back programs.
